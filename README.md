# DFA Project 1

## Overview
This project implements a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that processes input strings consisting of the characters 'a' and 'b'. The DFA is designed to accept specific patterns defined by its states and transitions.

## Features
- Initializes with a set of states, a start state, accept states, and transitions.
- Processes input strings and determines if they are accepted by the DFA.
- Displays a transition table for better understanding of state transitions.
